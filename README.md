# Memory Game

Android game that exercises working memory and improves fluid memory via n-back.

# Educational Notes

**TL;DR:** It's not certain or clear that n-back increases fluid intelligence, nor how long the effects last even if it did. All we can say for sure: this game exercises your working memory and fluid intelligence. It may or may not have any beneficial side-effects.

Regarding working memory, all we can suggest is that working memory is positively correlated with IQ. In experiments where certain things increased working memory, those same test subjects also fared better in IQ tests.

N-back presents a much more mixed picture. For example, [the n-back Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back) suggests the following:

> there are few studies which explore the convergent validity of the n-back task with other measures of working memory.[4] Those studies have largely revealed weak or modest correlations between individuals' performance on the n-back task and performance on other standard, accepted assessments of working memory.[4][5]

> The 2008 study was replicated in 2010 with results indicating that practicing single n-back may be almost equal to dual n-back in increasing the score on tests measuring Gf (fluid intelligence). The single n-back test used was the visual test, leaving out the audio test.[9] In 2011, the same authors showed long-lasting transfer effect in some conditions.[10]

> Two studies published in 2012 failed to reproduce the effect of dual n-back training on fluid intelligence. These studies found that the effects of training did not transfer to any other cognitive ability tests.[11][12] [...] The question of whether n-back training produces real-world improvements to working memory remains controversial.

On the positive side:

> The n-back is now in use outside experimental, clinical, and medical settings. Tutoring companies utilize versions of the task (in conjunction with other cognitive tasks) to allegedly improve the fluid intelligence of their clients.[15] Tutoring companies and psychologists also utilize the task to improve the focus of individuals with ADHD[15] and to rehabilitate sufferers of traumatic brain injury;[16] experiments have found evidence that practice with the task helps these individuals focus for up to eight months following training.[16] However, much debate remains about whether training on the n-back and similar tasks can improve performance in the long run or whether the effects of training are transient,[15][16] and if the effects of training n-back generalize to general cognitive processing, for instance, to fluid intelligence.[17] 

We leave it up to players and parents to decide whether this makes the game worth playing or not.
